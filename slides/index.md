## 2Pet3: Wake Up!
1. Don't assume **Continuity** <span class="hl2">(v3-4)</span>
2. Remember **Creation** + Flood <span class="hl2">(v5-7)</span>
3. God's patience is **Charity** <span class="hl2">(v8-9)</span>
4. Imminent **Cataclysm** <span class="hl2">(v10)</span>
5. Anticipate Christ's **Coming** <span class="hl2">(v11-13)</span>

## Continuity (v3-4)
Above all, you must understand that <br/>
in the last days **scoffers** will come, <br/>
scoffing and following their own **evil desires**.

They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he **promised**? <br/>
Ever since our ancestors died, everything **goes on** <br/>
as it has since the **beginning** of creation.”

---

## Complacency of Continuity

+ **Legalism** / pride: up to us to save the world
+ **Lusts**: indulge own desires
[(Jude 18)](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jude18)
+ **Laziness**: when the Master is away
[(Mt24:45-51)](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt24.45-51)

## Have I succumbed to <br/> **legalism**, **lust**, or **laziness**

## Creation + Flood (v5-7)
But they **deliberately forget** that long ago <br/>
by God’s word the **heavens** came into **being** <br/>
and the **earth** was **formed** out of water and by water.

By these waters also the **world of that time** <br/>
was deluged and destroyed.

By the same word the **present heavens and earth** <br/>
are reserved for **fire**, being kept for the <br/>
**day of judgment** and destruction of the ungodly.

## 1 Peter 3:20-21 (NIV)
God waited **patiently** in the days of Noah <br/>
while the **ark** was being built.

In it only a few people, **eight** in all, <br/>
were saved through **water**, and this water <br/>
symbolizes **baptism** that now saves you also --

not the removal of **dirt** from the body <br/>
but the pledge of a clear **conscience** toward God.

It saves you by the **resurrection** of Jesus Christ.

## Charity (v8-9)
But do not **forget** this one thing, dear friends: <br/>
With the Lord a **day** is like a **thousand years**, <br/>
and a thousand years are like a day.

The Lord is not **slow** in keeping his promise, <br/>
as some understand slowness.

Instead he is **patient** with you, <br/>
not wanting anyone to **perish**, <br/>
but everyone to come to **repentance**.

## If it is only God's **patience** <br/> toward the **not-yet-repentant**
## that **holds back** the judgment,

## Cataclysm (v10)
But the day of the Lord will come like a **thief**.

The **heavens** will disappear with a **roar**; <br/>
the **elements** will be destroyed by **fire**,

and the earth and everything **done** in it <br/>
will be **laid bare**.

## Coming (v11-13)
Since everything will be destroyed in this way, <br/>
what **kind of people** ought you to be?

You ought to live **holy** and **godly** lives as you <br/>
**look forward** to the day of God and **speed** its coming.

[...] In keeping with his **promise** we are <br/>
looking forward to a **new heaven** and a **new earth**, <br/>
where righteousness dwells.
