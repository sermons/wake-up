# Wake Up!
## 2 Peter 3:3-13

>>>
Speaker notes go here.

---

## 2 Peter 3:3-4 (NIV) (p.1/5)
Above all, you must understand that <br/>
in the last days scoffers will come, <br/>
scoffing and following their own evil desires.

They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? <br/>
Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on <br/>
as it has since the beginning of creation.”

---

## 2 Peter 3:5-7 (NIV) (p.2/5)
But they deliberately forget that long ago <br/>
by God’s word the heavens came into being <br/>
and the earth was formed out of water and by water.

By these waters also the world of that time <br/>
was deluged and destroyed.

By the same word the present heavens and earth <br/>
are reserved for fire, being kept for the <br/>
day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.

---

## 2 Peter 3:8-9 (NIV) (p.3/5)
But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: <br/>
With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, <br/>
and a thousand years are like a day.

The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, <br/>
as some understand slowness.

Instead he is patient with you, <br/>
not wanting anyone to perish, <br/>
but everyone to come to repentance.

---

## 2 Peter 3:10 (NIV) (p.4/5)
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief.

The heavens will disappear with a roar; <br/>
the elements will be destroyed by fire,

and the earth and everything done in it <br/>
will be laid bare.

---

## 2 Peter 3:11-13 (NIV) (p.5/5)
Since everything will be destroyed in this way, <br/>
what kind of people ought you to be? <br/>
You ought to live holy and godly lives as you <br/>
look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.

That day will bring about <br/>
the destruction of the heavens by fire, <br/>
and the elements will melt in the heat.

But in keeping with his promise we are <br/>
looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, <br/>
where righteousness dwells.

## Those who assume **continuity** of the world forget **creation** and make light of God's **charity**
## In view of the imminent **cataclysm**, anticipate Christ's **coming** by living holy and reverent lives

---

## 2Pet3: Wake Up!
1. Don't assume **Continuity** <span class="hl1">(v3-4)</span>
2. Remember **Creation** + Flood <span class="hl1">(v5-7)</span>
3. God's patience: **Charity** <span class="hl1">(v8-9)</span>
4. Imminent **Cataclysm** <span class="hl1">(v10)</span>
5. Anticipate Christ's **Coming** <span class="hl1">(v11-13)</span>

---

## Continuity (v3-4)
Above all, you must understand that <br/>
in the last days **scoffers** will come, <br/>
scoffing and following their own **evil desires**.

They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he **promised**? <br/>
Ever since our ancestors died, everything **goes on** <br/>
as it has since the **beginning** of creation.”

---

## Complacency of Continuity

+ **Legalism** / pride: up to us to save the world
+ **Lusts**: indulge own desires
[(Jude 18)](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jude18)
+ **Laziness**: when the Master is away
[(Mt24:45-51)](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt24.45-51)

---
<!-- .slide: class="Q" data-background="white" -->
## Have I succumbed to **legalism**, **lust**, or **laziness**
## by neglecting the imminence of Christ's return?

---

## Creation + Flood (v5-7)
But they **deliberately forget** that long ago <br/>
by God’s word the **heavens** came into **being** <br/>
and the **earth** was **formed** out of water and by water.

By these waters also the **world of that time** <br/>
was deluged and destroyed.

By the same word the **present heavens and earth** <br/>
are reserved for **fire**, being kept for the <br/>
**day of judgment** and destruction of the ungodly.

---
<!-- .slide: class="Q" data-background="white" -->
## What is my **attitude** toward **Creation** and the **Flood**?

>>>
+ Myth? Allegory? Moral fable?
+ Historical reality that warns us of the real future judgment

---

## Charity (v8-9)
But do not **forget** this one thing, dear friends: <br/>
With the Lord a day is like a **thousand years**, <br/>
and a thousand years are like a day.

The Lord is not **slow** in keeping his promise, <br/>
as some understand slowness.

Instead he is **patient** with you, <br/>
not wanting anyone to **perish**, <br/>
but everyone to come to **repentance**.

---
<!-- .slide: class="Q" data-background="white" -->
## If it is only God's **patience** toward the **not-yet-repentant**
## that **holds back** the judgment,
## how does that change how I **view** them?

---

## Cataclysm (v10)
But the day of the Lord will come like a **thief**.

The **heavens** will disappear with a **roar**; <br/>
the **elements** will be destroyed by **fire**,

and the earth and everything **done** in it <br/>
will be **laid bare**.

---
<!-- .slide: class="Q" data-background="white" -->
## What in this world do I **hold onto** which will be **burned** with the elements?

---

## Coming (v11-13)
Since everything will be destroyed in this way, <br/>
what **kind of people** ought you to be? <br/>
You ought to live **holy** and **godly** lives as you <br/>
**look forward** to the day of God and **speed** its coming.

That day will bring about <br/>
the destruction of the heavens by fire, <br/>
and the elements will melt in the heat.

But in keeping with his **promise** we are <br/>
looking forward to a **new heaven** and a **new earth**, <br/>
where righteousness dwells.

## Does my **lifestyle** and **reverence** welcome Christ's return?
