## 2Pet3: Wake Up!
1. Don't assume **Continuity** <span class="hl2">(v3-4)</span>
2. Remember **Creation** + Flood <span class="hl2">(v5-7)</span>
3. God's patience is **Charity** <span class="hl2">(v8-9)</span>
4. A **Cataclysm** is Imminent <span class="hl2">(v10)</span>
5. Anticipate Christ's **Coming** <span class="hl2">(v11-13)</span>

>>>
Those who assume **continuity** of the world forget about **creation** and <br/> make light of God's **charity**.
In view of the imminent **cataclysm**, anticipate Christ's **coming** <br/> by living holy and reverent lives.

---

## Continuity (v3-4)
Above all, you must understand that <br/>
in the last days **scoffers** will come, <br/>
scoffing and following their own **evil desires**.

They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he **promised**? <br/>
Ever since our ancestors died, everything **goes on** <br/>
as it has since the **beginning** of creation.”

---

## Complacency of Continuity

+ **Legalism** / pride: up to us to save the world
+ **Lusts**: indulge own desires
[(Jude 18-19)](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jude18-19)
+ **Laziness**: when the Master is away
[(Mt24:45-51)](https://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt24.45-51)

---

## Jude 1:18-19 (ESV)
In the last time there will be **scoffers**, <br/>
following their own ungodly **passions**.

It is these who cause **divisions**, <br/>
**worldly** people, devoid of the **Spirit**.

## Matthew 24:45-47 (NIV) (p.1/2)
Who then is the **faithful** and **wise** servant, <br/>
whom the master has put in **charge** <br/>
of the servants in his household <br/>
to give them their **food** at the proper time?

It will be **good** for that servant <br/>
whose master finds him doing so when he **returns**.

Truly I tell you, he will put him <br/>
in charge of all his possessions.

## Matthew 24:48-51 (NIV) (p.2/2)
But suppose that servant is **wicked** <br/>
and says to himself, <br/>
‘My master is staying away a **long time**,’

and he then begins to **beat** his fellow servants <br/>
and to **eat** and **drink** with drunkards.

The master of that servant will come <br/>
on a day when he **does not expect** him <br/>
and at an hour he is **not aware** of.

He will cut him to **pieces** <br/>
and assign him a place with the **hypocrites**, <br/>
where there will be **weeping** and gnashing of teeth.

But they **deliberately forget** that long ago <br/>

By these waters also the **world of that time** <br/>

But do not **forget** this one thing, dear friends: <br/>
With the Lord a **day** is like a **thousand years**, <br/>

The Lord is not **slow** in keeping his promise, <br/>
as some understand slowness.

Instead he is **patient** with you, <br/>
not wanting anyone to **perish**, <br/>
but everyone to come to **repentance**.
