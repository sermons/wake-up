## 2 Peter 3:3-4 (NIV) (p.1/5)
Above all, you must understand that <br/>
in the last days scoffers will come, <br/>
scoffing and following their own evil desires.

They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? <br/>
Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on <br/>
as it has since the beginning of creation.”

---

## 2 Peter 3:5-7 (NIV) (p.2/5)
But they deliberately forget that long ago <br/>
by God’s word the heavens came into being <br/>
and the earth was formed out of water and by water.

By these waters also the world of that time <br/>
was deluged and destroyed.

By the same word the present heavens and earth <br/>
are reserved for fire, being kept for the <br/>
day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.

---

## 2 Peter 3:8-9 (NIV) (p.3/5)
But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: <br/>
With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, <br/>
and a thousand years are like a day.

The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, <br/>
as some understand slowness.

Instead he is patient with you, <br/>
not wanting anyone to perish, <br/>
but everyone to come to repentance.

---

## 2 Peter 3:10 (NIV) (p.4/5)
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief.

The heavens will disappear with a roar; <br/>
the elements will be destroyed by fire,

and the earth and everything done in it <br/>
will be laid bare.

---

## 2 Peter 3:11-13 (NIV) (p.5/5)
Since everything will be destroyed in this way, <br/>
what kind of people ought you to be? <br/>
You ought to live holy and godly lives as you <br/>
look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.

That day will bring about <br/>
the destruction of the heavens by fire, <br/>
and the elements will melt in the heat.

But in keeping with his promise we are <br/>
looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, <br/>
where righteousness dwells.

God waited **patiently** in the days of Noah <br/>
while the **ark** was being built.

In it only a few people, **eight** in all, <br/>
were saved through **water** ...

... and this water symbolizes **baptism** <br/>
that now saves you also --

not the removal of **dirt** from the body <br/>
but the pledge of a clear **conscience** <br/>
toward God.

It saves you by the **resurrection** of Jesus Christ.
