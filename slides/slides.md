Above all, you must understand that <br/>
in the last days **scoffers** will come, <br/>
scoffing and following their own **evil desires**.

They will say, <br/>
“Where is this ‘coming’ he **promised**? <br/>
Ever since our ancestors died, <br/>
everything **goes on** <br/>
as it has since the **beginning** of creation.”

In the last time there will be **scoffers**, <br/>
following their own ungodly **passions**.

It is these who cause **divisions**, <br/>
**worldly** people, devoid of the **Spirit**.

## Charity (v8-9)
But do not **forget** this one thing, dear friends: <br/>
With the Lord a **day** is like a **thousand years**, <br/>
and a thousand years are like a day.

The Lord is not **slow** in keeping his promise, <br/>
as some understand slowness.

Instead he is **patient** with you, <br/>
not wanting anyone to **perish**, <br/>
but everyone to come to **repentance**.
